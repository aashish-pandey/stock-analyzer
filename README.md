# Stock Analyzer 🚀

Oh, you're here? Great. Let me tell you about this project that's probably going to make you rich (or at least make you feel like you understand the stock market).

## What's This?

A stock analyzer that's smarter than your average bear (market). It's like having a crystal ball, but with more data and less mysticism.

## Why Should You Care?

- Because you're tired of losing money
- Because you want to pretend you know what you're doing
- Because you're here, aren't you?

## Setup

```bash
# If you don't know how to do this, maybe stocks aren't for you
npm install
npm start
```

## Disclaimer

This won't make you a millionaire overnight. But hey, at least you're trying, right? 🤷‍♂️
